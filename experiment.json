    "description": "Subjects are asked to remember a set of six stimuli presented in a 2x3 matrix, there is a delay interval, and then they are told to forget either the top 3 or bottom 3 stimuli, there is a second delay interval, and then subjects are probed with a single stimulus. This stimulus can be one of the remaining 3 in the memory set (positive), one of the 3 that subjects were directed to forget (forget), or a stimulus that was originally part of the memory set (control). Subjects should respond with one key for 'yes' if it is a positive stimulus and the other key for 'no' if it is either a forget or control sitmulus.",
